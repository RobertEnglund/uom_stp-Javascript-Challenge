### University of Minnesota Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp
### Start date: 9/14/2020
### Week 14: Intro to JavaScript
### Home work due: 01/09/2021

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Create a basic HTML web page or use the h5ml file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Make sure you have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
